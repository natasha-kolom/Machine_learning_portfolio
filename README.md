## Project List

### Bank Customer Churn Prediction

- **Directory**: `bank-customer-churn-prediction`
- **Description**: This project focuses on predicting customer churn using data from the *Bank Customer Churn Prediction (DLU Course)* dataset. Our goal is to create a classification model to determine whether a customer will continue using their bank account or close it.
- **Methods**: We implemented gradient-boosting algorithms, specifically **XGBoost** and **LightGBM**, to optimize model accuracy. Additionally, the **HyperOpt** library was used for hyperparameter tuning.
- **Key Objective**: Accurately predict customer churn to help banks enhance customer retention strategies.

### Store Demand Time Series Modeling

- **Directory**: `store-demand-time-series-modeling`
- **Description**: In this project, we develop a time series forecasting model using data from the *Store Item Demand Forecasting Challenge* dataset.
- **Methods**: Our approach includes exploring seasonality, trends, and autocorrelation in the data to predict daily sales for each item-store pair. We use five years of historical sales data to generate demand forecasts.
- **Key Objective**: Provide accurate daily demand forecasts at the item-store level to support inventory management and reduce stockouts or overstocking.

Each project directory contains:

- **Detailed Notebooks and Code**: Organized and well-documented code to guide through the solution process.
- **Model Insights and Results**: Key findings and performance metrics to highlight each model's effectiveness.

Feel free to explore each folder to dive into the specifics of the models, the code, and the results of each project.
